# 2.6: Carrier Transport
### 2.6.1: Carrier Drift

Drift is defined as charged particle motion in response to an applied electric field. Drift carrier densities: $J_{p}$ and $J_{{n}}$


### 2.6.2: Carrier Diffusion

Diffusion is defined as the particle motion due to a gradient in the particle concentration. Fick's Law describes diffusion as the particle flux density F $[particles/cm^2s]$ is proportional to the negative gradient of the particle concentration: $F=-D\nabla_{\eta}$
