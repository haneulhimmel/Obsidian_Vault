- C++ and Object Oriented Programming
	- 2 Main Components: Classes and Objects
	- Pillars of OOP
		- Encapsulation -> Classes "encapsulate" attributes and behaviors into objects
		- Inheritance -> Classes can extend into other classes based on defined relations
		- Polymorphism -> One operation/function can have different meanings across classes
	- Class
		1. Well-defined attributes (variables/components associated w/ class) and behaviors (interface)
	- Objects
		1. Instances of the class
