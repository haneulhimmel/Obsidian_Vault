- Handover process -> Ensure Compatibility between different BIOSes, bootloaders, and kernels

- Bios
	- Reset Vector: First addr fetched and executed -> at 0xfffffff0
		- 12 MSB set high, 20 bits (1MB) of addressability
	- First 16 bytes of the ROM chip w/ instruct to exec
		- Bootloader must always contain a jump to the initialization code in those top 16 bytes
	- Bios Handover: Real Mode
		- 16 bit w/ 16 bit regs
		- Phys addr calculated as CS (Code segment) <<4 + IP
			- Phys addr = 16 * segment register + offset --> equivalent to above expression
			- Bits of memory allowed to address w/ this -> 
			- How do we get to addressing 1MB of phys addr space -> 
		- Combability to old kernel OS requires real mode
	- IVT: Interrupt handling
- Bootloader/Bootblock
	- State of CPU during exec of bootblock -> 16 bit real mode
	- State of memory subsys -> Naive memory addressing model
		- Physical access to mem
		- No aliasing
		- Need to transition to real-protected mode
	- Sets up
		- x86 state -> regs
		- Mem referencing model (segmentation etc.)
		- Switch processor to 32-bit protected
		- BIOS features (memory aliasing etc.)
	- **Reset Vector** stores an address at which an assembly instruct is held -> contains a jump to the main code to execute
- Kernel
