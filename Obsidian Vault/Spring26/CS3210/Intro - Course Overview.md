- Operating Systems Overview
	- Classically, 3 Responsibilities
		1. Manage Computer Resources
		2. Establish a user interface
		3. Execute and provide services for applications
	- Provide abstractions --> ex: OS abstracts 1 CPU into many processes
		1. Isolation: Between processes -> The effects of other processes should not affect nondependent others
		2. Multiplexing: 
		3. Naming: 
		4. Atomicity: All-or-nothing semantic -> As one block to avoid inconsistencies from showing
		5. Reliability: Fault tolerance
		6. Persistence: 
		7. Resource Management
	- Manage complexity through abstractions -> Identify common patterns to abstract the lower-level details to get to the services provided by those details and connect it to the system
