### General Overview

Defined as mathematical technique used to convert/map a mathematical problem and solution into another utilizing complex variables.

Essentially, we can take complex/irregular/difficult geometries and map them to simpler, manageable shape (circles and half planes) while maintaining the local angles, allowing for easier calculations and derivations on different planes.
